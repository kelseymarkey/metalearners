# metalearners

Inspired by the [ML Reproducibility Challenge](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020), this repo aims to reproduce synthetic data experiments conducted in the paper ["Metalearners for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using machine learning"](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/10/4156.full.pdf) by Soren R. Kunzel, Jasjeet S. Sekhona, Peter J. Bickela, and Bin Yu. To replicate these results we make minor adjustments to code put forth in their public repository, https://github.com/soerenkuenzel/causalToolbox. We make no claims of ownership to this code and any futher uses should make reference to the original paper.
